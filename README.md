# Disclaimer
This game is being developed using Godot Engine. While I'm no professional game developer myself, I sometimes like to code games for fun and since I really liked how this project is turning out, I decided to document my progress â€” which will most likely be very slow.
<p>I don't plan on publishing Still Alive, apart from releasing playable versions of the game to my friends. Still, I will provide my scripts in hopes my solutions can help out aspiring game developers like me.</p>
