# Game Description
In Still Alive, the player's objective is to protect their base from zombies' attacks. For that, they will have to collect gun parts in order to unlock stronger guns and deal more damage to zombies. The player will also be capable of creating unique builds during each run by leveling up and unlocking different perks. The more zombies they kill, the more they level up.
<p>Aside from leveling the player up during a run, zombies' deaths will randomly drop ammunition, first aid kits and gun parts. Different zombies will deal different amounts of damage to the player. </p>
<p>Every time the player dies, their level up progress will be reseted. When that happens, the player will be teleported to their base to prepare for another run. To initiate a run, the player must leave the base and go to the Wasteland.</p>
<p>Each run will happen in waves and all waves will have different time duration. The longer the player survives, the harder the waves will become. The player will be able to buy ammunition and first aid kits between each wave in the safe zone, but they will take damage if the wave starts and the player isn't found in the combat zone.</p>
